          HEALTH is an American noise rock band formed in Los Angeles in 2006.
          The band's lineup consists of Jake Duzsik, Jupiter Keyes, John
          Famiglietti, and Benjamin Jared Miller. Known for their experimental
          and abrasive sound, HEALTH has carved a unique niche in the
          alternative music scene.
        </p>
        <p class="band-description__text">
          The band gained critical acclaim for their self-titled debut album,
          released in 2007, which featured the popular track "Crimewave." HEALTH
          has since continued to evolve their sound, incorporating elements of
          noise, electronic, and industrial music into their discography.
        </p>
        <p class="band-description__text">
          With their intense and energetic live performances, HEALTH has built a
          dedicated fanbase. Their albums, including "Get Color" and "Death
          Magic," showcase a dynamic range of sonic landscapes, blending
          distorted guitars with electronic beats and haunting vocals.
